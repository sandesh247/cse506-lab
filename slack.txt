Note: Remember to mutate the line for late hours so that the script is
not confused and that there is only 1 entry of the specified
format. That entry should be for the current assignment being
submitted.

Ex.5.3: The 4MiB mapping is required since we should maintain the same
addresses for EIP to point to a valid instruction in memory. We think
that once cs is loaded with the right segment offset, this mapping can
be deleted.

Ex.5.4: The permission bits on the pages are set appropriately

Ex.5.5: JOS is limited to using only 256MiB of physical memory since
the KERNBASE is 0xf0000000 and the maximum addressable memory is
0xffffffff. The difference between the two is 256MiB.

Ex.5.6: Space overhead for manging memory:
* pages array: 1 entry of size sizeof(struct Page) for each physical
page
* page directory: 4kiB
* page tables: 1 PT for every 4MiB of RAM, which is approximately 64
Page Tables, each of which occupies 4KiB in memory, totalling 265kB of
memory overhead for Page Tables.
